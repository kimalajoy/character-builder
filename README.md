# D&D Character Builder

## Abstract
This D&D character builder utilizes the D&D 5e API to help you create your next D&D character. You are able to choose from the available races and classes to learn more about each and once you have selected you can name your character and save it locally for reference later. The app also utilizes the Dicebear Avatars API to randomly generate an avatar for your character.

### Future Iterations
I would like to update the app to include a random stat generator for a characters base stats as well as provide additional information regarding the proficiencies, skills and equipment that is available to base characters.
